### **Week 1: Foundation, Data, & Initial Modeling**

**Overall Focus:** Get the data processed, perform thorough EDA, and establish baseline models.

**Phase 1: Foundation & Data Acquisition (Days 1-2)**

* **All Members (Day 1 Morning):**
    * Jointly confirm understanding of the project plan and deliverables.
    * Set up communication channels and regular check-in times (e.g., daily stand-ups).
* **Hendrix (Lead, Day 1-2):**
    * `1. Project Setup & Environment Configuration` (Python, Git, core libraries). Ryan to assist if needed.
    * `2. Data Acquisition and Initial Understanding`: Load data, initial EDA (`.shape`, `.info()`, `.describe()`).
    * **Crucial:** `Confirm WQI relationship` and report findings by end of Day 2.
    * Detailed EDA: Target variable distribution, feature distributions, identifier ID, categorical/numerical assessment.
* **Ryan (Day 1-2):**
    * Ensure project directory structure is sound and Git repository is functioning for all.
    * Start drafting "Problem Statement, Relevance, Objectives" sections of the report.

**Phase 2 (Partial): Data Preparation & Initial Modeling (Days 3-7)**

* **Hendrix (Lead, Day 3-4):**
    * `3. Data Preprocessing`: Feature selection (`WQI` exclusion, identifiers), `Latitude`/`Longitude` decisions.
    * Missing value imputation.
    * Outlier detection and treatment.
    * **Handover preprocessed dataset (version 1) to Fernado by end of Day 4.**
* **Fernado (Lead, Day 3-7):**
    * `3. Data Preprocessing (with Hendrix)`: Discuss and implement feature encoding strategy (Day 3-4).
    * Implement feature scaling (Day 4).
    * `4. Model Selection, Training, and Baseline Evaluation`:
        * Data splitting (stratified) (Day 4).
        * Begin training baseline models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) (Day 5).
        * Train more complex models (RF, SVM, consider Gradient Boosting) (Day 6-7).
        * Conduct initial evaluation and feature importance analysis (Day 6-7).
        * **Report baseline model performance by end of Week 1 (Day 7).**
* **Wan (Days 5-7):**
    * Begin researching Streamlit/Flask and planning UI structure based on expected features (from Hendrix) and model I/O (from Fernado).
    * Start developing basic UI layout mockups/wireframes.
* **Ryan (Days 3-7):**
    * Document EDA findings from Hendrix.
    * Start drafting "Dataset Description" and "Preprocessing Steps" for the report.
    * Monitor progress against the plan.

### **Week 2: Optimization, Prototyping, & Deliverables**

**Overall Focus:** Optimize the best model, build the prototype, and complete all documentation and presentation materials.

**Phase 2 (Completion) & Phase 3: Optimization & Prototyping (Days 8-11)**

* **Fernado (Lead, Day 8-9):**
    * `5. Hyperparameter Tuning & Model Optimization`: Based on Week 1 results, select the best model(s) for tuning.
    * Perform hyperparameter tuning and retrain the optimized model.
    * Conduct final robust evaluation on the test set.
    * **Finalize the trained model and preprocessing pipeline by end of Day 9 and hand over to Wan.**
* **Wan (Lead, Day 8-11):**
    * `6. Prototype Development (UI)`:
        * Develop UI to accept numerical and categorical inputs (Day 8-9).
        * Implement input validation (Day 9).
        * Integrate Fernado's finalized model and preprocessing pipeline (Day 10).
        * Test prototype thoroughly and refine (Day 10-11).
        * **Have a functional prototype ready for demonstration by end of Day 11.**
* **Hendrix (Days 8-10):**
    * Finalize and write up the "Dataset Description, EDA, and Preprocessing Steps" section of the report based on any final adjustments.
    * Prepare data-related visuals for the video showcase.
* **Ryan (Days 8-11):**
    * Work with Fernado to document "Model Selection, Training, Evaluation, Feature Importance, and Hyperparameter Tuning."
    * Work with Wan to document "Prototype Design."
    * Keep overall project report compilation on track.

**Phase 4: Deliverables & Presentation (Days 12-14)**

* **Ryan (Lead, Day 12-14):**
    * `7. Project Documentation & Reporting`:
        * Compile all sections into the final 5-page report. Ensure all code is commented.
        * Write "Conclusions, System Impact, Limitations, and Future Potential."
        * **Final report draft ready for team review by end of Day 13.**
        * Package all deliverables (code, model, prototype).
    * `8. Video Showcase Preparation`:
        * Develop script and storyboard for the video (Day 12).
        * Coordinate with team members for their content.
* **All Members (Day 12-14):**
    * **Wan:** Record a clear demonstration of the prototype (Day 12).
    * **Fernado & Hendrix:** Prepare slides/visuals explaining their respective parts (model, data insights) for the video (Day 12).
    * **Ryan:** Compile and edit the video presentation (Day 13-14).
    * **All:** Review final report and video. Practice any spoken parts for the video if applicable.
    * **Final submission of all deliverables (Day 14).**

### **Daily Commitments (Example):**

* **Morning (e.g., 30 mins):** Daily stand-up. What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any blockers? (Ryan to facilitate).
* **Working Blocks:** Focused individual/pair work on assigned tasks.
* **End of Day (e.g., 15-30 mins):** Quick check-in on progress, update task board/plan (Ryan).

This is an ambitious timeline, so clear roles, consistent effort, and proactive communication about any roadblocks will be absolutely essential! Good luck! ðŸš€
