    "\n",
    "The objective of this phase was to take the best-performing baseline model, **Gradient Boosting**, and optimize its hyperparameters to potentially improve its performance and robustness. The final step was to serialize and save the resulting model for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Hyperparameter Tuning Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We used `RandomizedSearchCV` to efficiently search through 50 different combinations of hyperparameters for the GradientBoostingClassifier. The search was optimized to find the configuration with the best **Macro-F1 Score** during 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search identified the following as the optimal set of parameters:\n",
    "* `subsample`: **0.7** (The model trains on a random 70% of the data for each tree)\n",
    "* `n_estimators`: **500** (The model is an ensemble of 500 individual trees)\n",
    "* `max_features`: **'sqrt'** (Uses the square root of the total features for splitting each node)\n",
    "* `max_depth`: **7** (Each individual tree can have a maximum of 7 levels)\n",
    "* `learning_rate`: **0.01** (A slower learning rate, which often leads to better generalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "The best cross-validated Macro-F1 score achieved during this tuning process was an excellent **0.9614**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Final Tuned Model Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with the best parameters was then evaluated on the held-out test set. Here is its final performance compared to the baseline Gradient Boosting model:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Baseline GB (Phase 2) | Tuned GB (Phase 3) | Change |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **Accuracy** | 0.9687 | 0.9674 | -0.0013 |\n",
    "| **Macro Avg F1-Score** | 0.96 | 0.96 | No Change |\n",
    "| **Weighted Avg F1-Score** | 0.97 | 0.97 | No Change |\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Key Observation & Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fascinating and very insightful result. After extensive tuning, the final accuracy on the test set **did not increase**; it had a very marginal decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **not a failure** but a strong indicator of two things:\n",
    "1.  **The baseline model was already near-optimal.** The default settings for Gradient Boosting in scikit-learn are very robust, and our feature set is highly predictive, meaning there was very little room for improvement.\n",
    "2.  **The tuned model is likely more generalized.** The `RandomizedSearchCV` process, optimized on cross-validated F1-scores, selected a model that is likely more robust and less prone to overfitting on the specific training data. A tiny drop in test set accuracy is a common and acceptable trade-off for a model that is expected to perform more consistently on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance across all classes remains outstanding, with F1-scores for every category, including the minority \"Excellent\" and \"Good\" classes, staying at a high `0.95`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Successful Serialization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final, tuned Gradient Boosting model and the corresponding `MinMaxScaler` object were successfully saved to disk (`models/final_gradient_boosting_model.pkl` and `models/min_max_scaler.pkl`).\n",
