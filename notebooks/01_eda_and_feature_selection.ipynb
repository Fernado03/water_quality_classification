The histograms consistently show that the data is concentrated at lower values, with a long tail extending towards higher values. The corresponding box plots for each of these features confirm this pattern, highlighting a significant number of outliers on the higher end. This is a typical characteristic of environmental data where baseline levels are common, but instances of high concentration (potential contamination) are also present.\n",

    "\n",
